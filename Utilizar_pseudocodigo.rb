#PseudocÃ³digo
#FIRST we define the students array with names and grades of students TOGETHER in arrays
#DEFINE the best_students method
#CREATE an empty array 'best_students' and set two variables (x, y) to zero
#DO WHILE y < studenths length, this to search in all the students array
#SET current student to equal to the student[x][y] in the students array
#CURRENT STUDENT is always an array with a name and a grade 
#IF current student grade is equal to 10 THEN we PUSH that student into the BEST STUDENTS
#IF x is equal to the length of the y'th array of students less one
#THEN SET x = 0 and y = y + 1
#ELSE, SET only x = x + 1
#ENDIF
#END WHILE
#RETURN BEST STUDENTS
#END METHOD
#DO test
